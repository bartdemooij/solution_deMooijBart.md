**Assignment CLS of Bart de Mooij (11217278)**

The title of the following searches are:
* MCC Van Dyke et al., 2019 --> Fantastic yeasts and where to find them: the hidden diversity of dimorphic fungal pathogens
* JT Harvey, Applied Ergonomics, 2002 --> An analysis of the forces required to drag sheep over various surfaces
* DW Ziegler et al., 2005 --> CORRELATION OF CONTINUOUS CARDIAC OUTPUT MEASURED BY A PULMONARY ARTERY CATHETER VERSUS IMPEDANCE CARDIOGRAPHY IN VENTILATED PATIENTS

The graph of the istherecorrelation.csv file is added as an additional file.
This graph does show some correlation because when WO increases, so does the Beer Consumption in NL.
